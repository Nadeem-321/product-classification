# 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

We train and compare:

| Model Name             | Type | Description |
|------------------------|------|-------------|
| Logistic Regression     | Linear Model | Good for simple datasets |
| Support Vector Machine  | Margin-Based | High accuracy for non-linear data |
| Random Forest          | Ensemble | Best for noisy/tabular data |
| Gradient Boosting      | Boosting | Highly accurate and robust |

The best performing model is **automatically selected and saved**.
