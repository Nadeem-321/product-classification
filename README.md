# 🏷️ Product Classification Machine Learning Model  
A complete end-to-end machine learning solution for classifying products into categories based on numerical and categorical features.

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains a **production-ready Product Classification Model** built using Python and scikit-learn.  
The goal is to classify products (mobile, laptop, tablet, smartwatch, headphones etc.) based on features like:

- Price  
- Weight  
- Size  
- Color (encoded)  
- Brand (encoded)

This model is fully ready for:
- Deployment  
- Industry demonstration  
- Machine learning portfolio  
- GitHub showcasing  
- Educational projects  
- Startup prototypes

## 🚀 Features

✔ Automatic data preprocessing  
✔ Missing value handling  
✔ Categorical encoding  
✔ Standard scaling  
✔ Training 4 ML models  
✔ Automatic model selection  
✔ Saving the best model as `.pkl`  
✔ Reusable prediction function  
✔ Logging for debugging  
✔ Ready for API deployment (e.g., Flask/FastAPI)

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

The script trains and compares the following algorithms:

- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
- **Random Forest Classifier**  
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier**

The model with the highest accuracy is automatically chosen and saved.
